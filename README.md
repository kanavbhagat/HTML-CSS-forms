# Sign-Up Form Project

This repository contains the **Sign-Up Form Project**, developed as part of the **Intermediate HTML and CSS Course** on The Odin Project. This project demonstrates the application of intermediate-level HTML and CSS concepts by creating a functional and visually appealing sign-up form.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a responsive and user-friendly sign-up form for an imaginary service. The form includes various input fields, validation states, and design elements that enhance user experience.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Design:** 
  - Inputs for First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password.
  - Clear visual indicators for invalid and focused input states using `:invalid` and `:focus` pseudo-classes.

- **Styling:**
  - Custom font integration using the `NorseBold` font.
  - Background image sidebar with an overlaid logo for branding.
  - Semi-transparent dark overlay for enhanced text readability.
  - Form container with shadow for a modern design.

- **Validation:**
  - Password fields display red borders for invalid input.
  - Focused input fields show a blue outline with subtle shadow.
  - Valid input fields are highlighted with green borders.

The project files include:

- **HTML:** 
  - Scaffolding for the form structure and content.
